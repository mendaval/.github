MendaVal is a for profit organization, endorsing spanish late capitalism. The "company" is co-founded by Braulio Méndez and Diego Valcarce, a couple of philanthropists based in A Coruña, Galicia. The name of the company comes from a combination of their lasts names, which also makes a pun in spanish, refering to ["vendaval"](https://dle.rae.es/vendaval), which means a strong wind.

They both also work as the voice of experience in a small startup in Lugo, so-called [Innogando](https://innogando.com).
